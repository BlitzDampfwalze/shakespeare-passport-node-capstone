## User Cases
This app is for three types of users:
1. READ - For Theatrical Students, so that they can track Plays that have been read (by title and author, optional edition) by date and include Notes.
2. SEEN - For Theatre-Goers (enthusiasts, specialists, insert-word-here), so that they can track all the shows the have seen, where and when they have seen them, and any specific Notes they would like to add.
3. PERFORMED - For Theatrical Artists and Perfomers, so that they can record all shows they have performed in by Role, Location, Date and include Notes (and Lines).
